# Heap: A tree-based data structure in which the value of a parent node is ordered in a certain way with respect to the value of its child node(s). A heap can be either a min heap (the value of a parent node is less than or equal to the value of its children) or a max heap (the value of a parent node is greater than or equal to the value of its children).

# Crucial Terms
# key: The values that determine the order. If you're storing numbers, the numbers can be the keys. If you're storing more complicated objects, the key is the data field that we're comparing by. Unlike in hash tables, keys in heaps do not have to be unique.
# extract_min: The method of (quickly) being able to extract the minimum element from the min-heap.

# Use Heaps When ...
# Finding the minimum distance between two nodes in a graph:
# The standard approach to this problem is to use Dijkstra's algorithm. One of the key steps in Dijkstra's algorithm is to select the node closest to a node that you have already completed, which is a minimum calculation.
# Getting the next event that is scheduled to occur:
# Storing events in a heap with a timestamp as the key gives you a fast way to extract the next event (the event with the smallest timestamp will occur next).
# Keep track of the median value while streaming:
# This is the running median problem, where two heaps are maintained: a max-heap for values below the current median and a min-heap for values above the current median. When a new value is inserted, it is placed in the low or high pile as appropriate (and the maximum of the low values or minimum of the low values are extracted as necessary to keep the two heaps sizes' different by at most one element).
# Find the first k non-repeating characters in a string in a single traversal.
